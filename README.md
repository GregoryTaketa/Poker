I do not yet have a ranking system for the cards.

Most sophisticated so far is 7-Card Stud (game simulation without the betting and the ranking hands):  
-Draws with only others' 3rd Street and above revealed to you
-Option to Fold Each Turn
-Computer players randomly Fold (without a ranking system, I do not yet have an optimization algorithm for computers to fold or hold)
-Win if last person standing
-Community card if 8 players and deck unable to provide everyone the River.
